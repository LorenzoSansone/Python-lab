# 🐍 Python Progress & OOP Lab

This repository is a **personal workspace** to organize, track, and consolidate everything I have learned — and will learn — about **Python**, with a strong focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

It is not necessarily a “learning from scratch” project, but rather a **living collection of knowledge**, experiments, and practical examples that evolve over time.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:
- Organize and document my Python knowledge in one place
- Track progress and improvements over time
- Revisit and refine previously learned concepts
- Explore and deepen **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, including:
  - Classes and objects
  - Inheritance
  - Composition
  - Encapsulation
  - Polymorphism
- Experiment with ideas, patterns, and implementations through code

## 🧪 What You'll Find Here

- 🧩 Python scripts and utilities
- 🧪 Tests, experiments, and proof-of-concepts
- 🏗️ OOP-focused exercises and mini-projects
- 📝 Notes, patterns, and reusable snippets

This repository is meant to be both a **reference** and a **playground**:
a place where existing knowledge is organized, and new ideas are explored.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

The structure and content may change as concepts evolve or new topics are added.
Some code may be exploratory, experimental, or intentionally simple.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

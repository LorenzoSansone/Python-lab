# 🐍 Python Progress & OOP Lab

This repository is a **personal workspace** to track my progress in **Python** and to **explore Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts through practice.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:
- Track my learning progress in Python over time
- Experiment with Python syntax, features, and best practices
- Explore **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts such as:
  - Classes and objects
  - Inheritance
  - Composition
  - Encapsulation
  - Polymorphism
- Write small scripts, tests, and experiments to reinforce learning

## 🧪 What You'll Find Here

- 🧩 Small Python scripts
- 🧪 Test files and experiments
- 🏗️ OOP-focused exercises and mini-projects
- 📝 Notes or code snippets related to learning

This repo is **not meant to be a polished library**, but rather a **learning sandbox** where code can evolve, break, and improve.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

The structure and content may change as I learn and experiment.
Some code may be incomplete or exploratory by design.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
